# SVMCrashlyticsPoC
Crashlytics for multiple environments

Ref: https://docs.fabric.io/apple/crashlytics/advanced-setup.html#apps-with-multiple-environments

Created 2 organisations: Development and Staging

Onboarded app for each organisation and added the required run scripts (have both in same project)

Removed APIKey from Info.plist and started Crashlytics via code


NOTE: We have the ability to change the server dynamically
